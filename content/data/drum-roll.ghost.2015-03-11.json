The messenger of the internet. You are entrusted with transporting an email of cat gifs from A to B when you lose control of the email and crash. The cat gifs are flung to the far corners of the web. You must travel through the internet and retrieve the lost cat gifs, using your coding skills to help you on the way.\n\n### Year of the Monkey\nOne day many monkeys were left in a room with a computer. After a long enough period of time, monkeys learned to code. They evolved into evil coding hominoids and plan to taunt humans with their newfound skill. Their first act of terror will be to destroy all the kitten gifs on the internet. It’s your job to save them.\n\nThe monkeys are so technologically advanced that they’ve found a way to get inside computers (Zoolander reference) and they try and stop you from reaching the gifs, after you’ve completed the first few levels. There is a boss at the end guarding the cutest kitten gif - you need to use all the coding skills you’ve learnt to get past him.\n\n### The Cute Wars\nRidiculously cute, attention seeking aliens have infiltrated the internet. They are generally harmless, they wander around feeding off adoration. \nBut they have a devastating enemy.. kittens. Kittens out-cute them. They always win. So photos of kittens make them turn green and faint, and actual kittens make their heads explode. \n\nIt is their mission to collect and destroy all kittens, using whatever means they have. It is your mission to save them, using code. \n\n### The Kitten Snatchers\nA rich, crazy cat lady has employed some of the world’s deadliest bounty hunters to kidnap the cutest kittens on the internet. Because she thinks her ‘babies’ are the cutest and doesn’t want there to be any competition. No-one’s taking this case as they believe humans have priority, so you volunteer. You learn code so you can foil her crazy plan.\n\n### Erase All Kittens\nUnbeknownst to us, all cute animals on the internet hate kittens. There is an internet hierarchy of cuteness, and they are always at the top.. they get more views than they deserve. So the other cute creatures on the internet have formed an army, and have vowed to rid the internet of all it’s kittens. \n\nYou have discovered this through intercepting a petition from the EAK board. (Erase All Kittens) You are intrigued and decide to fight against EAK. The cute creatures (including sneezing panda and teddy faced dog) try to stop you from recovering the hidden kittens.

We were too busy focusing on technicalities and the puzzle levels. The main character was simply an @ symbol, collecting kittens by rolling across the screen. Then for MozFest, it drastically evolved into a stick-like code man with curly brackets for a head. We called him code man.\n\nWe spent weeks designing the look and feel for the game. It was difficult because we knew there’d be restrictions within the code levels, but we still wanted a high level of detail. We looked at lots of different games, and how well the art style worked with the gameplay. Joe would come round to mine after work, we’d get tacos from Chilango down the road and do some research, ie. spend a few hours playing indie games like Machinarium and Limbo.\n\nI was particularly enraptured by Robot Unicorn Attack - I think the combination of the double jumps and life-affirming soundtrack could reform any hardened psychopath. If you crash and burn, it’s okay! ‘You became a star’. I still play it sometimes for a little boost of endorphins. \n\nAfter lots of research, we agreed on a colourful, geometric art style with a quirky tone of voice. At the start of December, I posted an ad on ConceptArt.org - a web community of artists - in hope that someone good would be interested and available. Amazingly, lots of people replied. Most of their portfolios were great, but we liked one girl’s in particular. She was the first person to reply to our ad - her name was Leonie, and she’d just graduated from Central Saint Martins.\n\nMe and Joe met her in a cafe in Liverpool Street, then we pretty much started working together straight away.

We were too busy focusing on technicalities and the puzzle levels. The main character was simply an @ symbol, collecting kittens by rolling across the screen. Then for MozFest, it drastically evolved into a stick-like code man with curly brackets for a head. We called him code man.</p>\n\n<p>We spent weeks designing the look and feel for the game. It was difficult because we knew there’d be restrictions within the code levels, but we still wanted a high level of detail. We looked at lots of different games, and how well the art style worked with the gameplay. Joe would come round to mine after work, we’d get tacos from Chilango down the road and do some research, ie. spend a few hours playing indie games like Machinarium and Limbo.</p>\n\n<p>I was particularly enraptured by Robot Unicorn Attack - I think the combination of the double jumps and life-affirming soundtrack could reform any hardened psychopath. If you crash and burn, it’s okay! ‘You became a star’. I still play it sometimes for a little boost of endorphins. </p>\n\n<p>After lots of research, we agreed on a colourful, geometric art style with a quirky tone of voice. At the start of December, I posted an ad on ConceptArt.org - a web community of artists - in hope that someone good would be interested and available. Amazingly, lots of people replied. Most of their portfolios were great, but we liked one girl’s in particular. She was the first person to reply to our ad - her name was Leonie, and she’d just graduated from Central Saint Martins.</p>\n\n<p>Me and Joe met her in a cafe in Liverpool Street, then we pretty much started working together straight away.

Game designers, developers, illustrators and sound artists in over 70 countries got together to create games, in just one weekend.\n\nMe, Joe and Leonie met up at the Institute on Friday evening, and excitedly walked into a crowded room where we were instantly hit by the unique fragrance of a hundred game designers. Also, there were hardly any girls there, so we really stood out! We were given a theme: *\"We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are\"*\n\nWe found this was oddly profound for a Friday night, and started to brainstorm ideas in teams. A sound artist, Douglas Hunter Pennant, joined our team, and we wandered off to the nearest pub. Coming up with ideas together was really fun, although it was tricky thinking of ones that were simple enough to create the graphics, animation and code for in 48 hours.\n\nOur first feasible idea involved seeing the world from a spider’s perspective, it’s goal being to escape a house and get beamed up by its alien-spider friends. A simpler one was ‘Bye Bye Bubbles’, a game about a suicidal goldfish, who tries to kill itself but keeps forgetting that it’s suicidal. Unfortunately it was deemed a bit too dark. After a few hours we walked back to the college, and carried on thinking of ideas. I started doodling some of them, and after mishearing something someone had said, I drew an octopus with the head of an elephant: an elephantopus. The others liked it’s naive, slightly confused look, and Joe came up with the name ‘The Emotional Core of Elephantopus’. \n\nWe decided that it was on a mission to find it’s soul-mate, in the dangerous depths of the ocean. When I was younger I was obsessed with programmes about the sea, so felt perfectly content spending Friday night drawing sea piglets and hostile jellyfish. Leonie and I designed creatures with different powers, whilst Joe created the source code for how the game would work. \n\nMany of the Global Game Jam participants were from outside of London, so they brought sleeping bags with them - some of them even pulling all-nighters to get their game finished. When Douglas asked us to describe the music we wanted on Saturday, we had a two minute discussion, then gave him some keywords - mysterious, underwatery, eerie. He came up with the perfect soundtrack a few hours later, which we all felt was true to the spirit of Elephantopus’s journey.

We're also now receiving support from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/about) and the [National College for Digital Skills](http://www.ncdigitalskills.org.uk/), in addition to TES, Mumsnet, Teach First, Children's University, Mozilla and CoderDojo.\n- We've received a high level of interest from a schools group who intend to purchase the beta version of E.A.K. for around 40 of their schools. We have a commercial meeting with them early next year.\n- The Global Director of Education for Microsoft recently contacted us - we have a meeting set up with him next month.\n\nWe're currently working on new levels for E.A.K. - we're building 6 levels every two weeks, and launching the first chapter of the game in April.
